# Compact Controller
Pressing the button opens the controller. On the controller there is a switch with two items, they change the height of the controller.
* The controller does not open to the full screen. The width is always 300pt.
* By default, the first item is selected with a height of 280pt. If you select the second item, the height becomes 150pt. The height changes animatedly.
* The close button in the top right corner closes the controller.
* The controller is bound to the center of the button with a triangle on top
